# Usability issues that need fixing in VSCode-PVS
1. Autocompletion gets on the way when editing a file.
2. Inability to cancel prover commands that take too long to complete (e.g,. typechecking or proof commands).
3. PVSio terminal lacks color coding for keywords and cursor cannot be moved with arrow keys (stty is not in raw mode).
